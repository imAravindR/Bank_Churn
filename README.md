Why and when will a customer leave his/her bank could be a challenging question to answer.

Here, we have a data from kaggle where all the historical information about a customer and whether he/she left the bank or not is available.

Our goal is to use the power of data science to help the bank identify those who are likely to leave the bank in future.
